# Implementing-a-CNN-for-Text-Classification-in-TensorFlow

 This project is implemented by following a [post](http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/) from [WILDML](http://www.wildml.com).This is a modification of dennybritz's code in [github](https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf).**This Code is easy to use**
 
 
# Requirements:

- tensorflow
- numpy
- os
- time
- datetime
- Image

# How to use:

1. Install Prerequisites

2. Run
   > python main.py

3.Type **train** for training

4.After training type **test** for testing
